# âš¡ DC Power Flow Enhancement â€“ Project 3 (ECE 2774)

This project enhances a Python-based power system simulator by implementing a **DC Power Flow** module using the linearized \( B\theta = P \) model. The enhancement enables scalable analysis of real power flows across buses with high computational efficiency, and has been validated through manual calculations and comparison with PowerWorld simulations.

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose and Theory

DC Power Flow is a simplified model used widely in planning and analysis. It is based on the following assumptions:

- Flat voltage profile: \( |V| = 1.0 \) p.u.
- Small angle differences: \( \sin(\delta_i - \delta_j) \approx \delta_i - \delta_j \)
- Negligible resistance
- Only real power is modeled

Where:
- \( B' \) is the reduced susceptance matrix (imaginary part of Ybus without the slack bus),
- \( P \) is the net real power injection vector (in p.u.),
- \( \delta \) is the bus voltage angle vector.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Overview

### ðŸ§± New Class: `DCPowerFlowSolver`
- Automatically builds \( B' \) and \( P \)
- Solves for \( \delta \) using NumPy
- Prints voltage angles in radians and degrees

### ðŸ”„ Circuit Class Enhancements
Added methods to retrieve total power per bus:
```python
def get_bus_generation(self, bus_name)
def get_bus_load(self, bus_name)
```

### ðŸ§ª Running the Solver
To run the DC power flow for any system:
```python
dc_solver = DCPowerFlowSolver(circuit)
dc_solver.solve()
dc_solver.display_results()
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Validation

### âœ… Test Case 1: 3-Bus System (Manual Validation)
- Small test system manually solved using MATLAB
- Matrix Bâ€² and vector P were defined explicitly
- Python simulation output matched manual solution:
  ![{BD04B8F2-5A8A-4851-9EF5-602CD4EA5D7D}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adde0b09-758e-4366-8181-01b888c3e13c)

- Error < 0.005Â°

### âœ… Test Case 2: 7-Bus System (PowerWorld Validation)
- Full 7-bus network (same from Project 2) tested
- DC Power Flow mode used in PowerWorld
- Python and PowerWorld angle results matched exactly
- Error < 0.01Â° at all buses
